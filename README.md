<h4>Project Title: Wordinator</h4>
<h5>Author: Sam Camus (xdothackerx) </h5>

Approach: Stumbled through documentation and tried various things. Tried to write a test but somehow couldn't comprehend how to make one.
Ended up with a bunch of inexplicable bugs including Sinatra somehow reading my commented out code (WTF!?) and not allowing me to assign variables
or use <> tags for HTML. Eventually... it started working, for no reason.
