This app takes two words inputted through the url and checks to see if they are anagrams of each other. It returns a JSON object with the inputs and the result.

Examples:  
In- http://localhost:4567/hello/sam  
Out- {"input1":"hello","input2":"sam","anagram?":false}

In- http://localhost:4567/doctorwho/torchwood  
Out- {"input1":"doctorwho","input2":"torchwood","anagram?":true}
